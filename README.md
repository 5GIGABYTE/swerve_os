# swerve_os
Welcome to my new project of Swerve! Swerve was possible by these people below... (LINKS TO THEIR WEBSITES WILL ALSO BE THERE) 

# Changelog

I am changing the "Swerve_OS" to a custom ISO bootable. It can vary from Windows XP to Windows 11.

# What is a custom ISO?

A custom ISO for windows is where it deleted a bunch of shitty bloatware (excuse my language) for a better preformance on your low OR high end computer!
